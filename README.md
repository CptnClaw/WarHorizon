WAR HORIZON
=================

War Horizon was my senior project at Computer Science class. I am now rewriting it from scratch as open source software. It is a turn-based strategy game influenced by Advance Wars for the GBA. It is written entirely in Java and it is cross-platform. 


Usage
-----

Just export everything to a jar and run it normally -
java -jar WarHorizon.jar
